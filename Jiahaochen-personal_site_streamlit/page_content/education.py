    ### 999 Dermatropin Marketing Program
    - Project Background:999 Dermatophores has remarkable efficacy, high brand awareness, and good market performance, but faces challenges such as fierce competition in social media, strict regulation of OTC drugs, brand aging, and consumers' concerns about the product's ingredients (e.g., hormones), etc. By analyzing the consumers' needs through big data, we can provide a marketing plan and set up a social media communication matrix to realize the rejuvenation of the brand.
    - Data Insights:Responsible for coordinating data insights, analyzing target demographics and interest preferences through the use of social listening and focus group research methods. Analyzed a large number of posts using the keywords “dermatitis” and “eczema” and found that consumers are concerned about skin problems and have a strong interest in related health knowledge and products. Consumers who are concerned about skin problems are concentrated in coastal areas, mostly in Guangdong; 80% of the audience is under 24 years old and are interested in traveling, food, outdoor activities and health.
    - Program planning: We propose to take “crispy youth” as the target group, and put forward strategy suggestions in terms of content and products. In terms of product innovation, it is proposed to explore new scenarios of product use, such as skin care after outdoor sports and first aid for skin under workplace stress, so as to enhance the added value and competitiveness of the products. In terms of content strategy, it is suggested to create interesting content around the life scenes and pain points of “crispy youth” to show the efficacy of the product, and utilize social media to promote the product accurately and expand its influence by combining online and offline activities.
